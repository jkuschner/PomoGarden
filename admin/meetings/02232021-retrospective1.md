# Sprint 1 Retrospective



## Feedback

### Workload/ Work balance

The majority of the group thinks the current amount of work and how it is distributed is currently adequate. There are a couple of concerns that there is not enough work and it is unclear who should be doing what.

### Meetings

Most of us are satisfied with how meetings are going currently. However, some of us think that they could be better organized and run more efficiently.

### General Organization

This is our biggest area for improvement: only half of us are satisfied with how are tasks are defined and assigned. The other half is ok with how they are defined, but wish to see more structure with how they are assigned.

### CI and Testing

Everyone is happy with the CI Pipeline, but half of us think we need to do more work on testing.



## Response

1. In order to improve organization and regulate the workload, we are going to get more specific about what tasks should be completed by whom. During planning meetings when we prioritize and point rank our tasks, we will also give each member assigned tasks.
2. To improve meeting efficiency, we will make and post a written agenda before each meeting.

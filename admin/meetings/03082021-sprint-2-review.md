## Business from previous meeting

Describe topics discussed from last meeting and how they are resolved

## New Business

- Sprint Review
  - Jared: Updated our CSS to have the app look better on smaller sized window screens and to have the colors for each theme fit with each fruit more.
  - Chi: Worked with design team to update the themes, made the animations 60fps, updated the "stop" button to be reset and actually clear pomos.
  - Patrick: Updated the settings button to have a slide in animation and did some manual testing on Firefox. Also added a few phiolosophy ADRs.
  - Leeor: Updated ADRs and created testing checklist for main button functionality.
  - Daniel: Worked on implementing the timer animations. Fixed a bug where the animation will be off by a few degrees.
  - Tommy: Implemented pulsing animation on the center button.
  - Jacinth: Working more with Cypress to get meaningful tests. Implemented theme tests to make sure those buttons in the settings are working.
  - Zach: Created agendas for meetings and ran team meetings. Also created testing checklist for the Settings options
  - Josh: Created agendas for meetings and ran team meetings. Also created testing checklist for scalability and put protections on our main branch.

- Pulsing animation
  - Discussion about how we should do the pulsing for the break button: ultimately we decided we want to keep the break button pulsing, but add a transition to white when the user clicks and then have the break start.
- Reset button Pop-up: completed
- Zach and Josh plan to create our project presentation rough draft tomorrow
- Retrospective survey will be released after this meeting.

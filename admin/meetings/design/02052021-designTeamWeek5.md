## Business from previous meeting

Finalizing our Figma wireframes

## New Business

We discussed some details about finalizing our wireframes on Figma, and planned what we need to focus on by the end of the week.

1. We will create two branches in Figma. The first one is our current build. This one will not involve any additional feature and animation, and we will try to keep it simple so our dev team can start working on that. The second one is for future build, we will try some fancy designs and put on other additional features in our miro board, and this should be close to our final product.

2. Break button: we decide to keep the break button, and a new popup window is added to let the user re-confirm to break the focus session to avoid the user from clicking it by mistake.

3. We decided to make the setting page into a side bar on a full-size screen. If the user is on a phone-size screen, then we make a separate setting page with a scroll view to fill the screen. 

4. No need to implement the animation at this time, but we kinda like the draining inner circle animation, and will possibly use that one in the future build.

5. We will keep the localization function in our future build.

6. We will allow users to hide the countdown time once we had our animation.

### Additions to agenda

By the end of week 5, our design team member will:
- Jared will focus on finalizing our wireframe on Figma so that our dev team can start working on the initial build
- Leeor will focus on user story and persona
- Patrick will focus on formal flow chart and system diagrams

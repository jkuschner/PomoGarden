    * Part-time job today. Will further refine the details of setting pagesâ€™ padding and corner radius this evening.
    * The whole page has been refined. All elements are scaled correctly, whether on full screens, narrow screens, mobile screens or very small windows, and all elements are visible and have the reasonable size and font.
       The color, size, position, font size and weight, and corner radius of all elements are now close to the design wireframe.

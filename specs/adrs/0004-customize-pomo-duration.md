# Give users ability to customize long break only

* Deciders: All
* Date: 2021-01-27

## Context and Problem Statement

What control should the user have over the durations in a pomo cycle?

## Considered Options

* Full customization power
* Only breaks
* Only long breaks

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Only long breaks", because 
* Gives the users some control and interation with the app
* Long breaks are long and not as often as other breaks, so chaning them won't go against pomo philosophy
* Other customization options could lead to confusing timer behavior

# No autoplay

* Deciders: All
* Date: 2021-01-27

## Context and Problem Statement

Should the timer automatically go into the next session after the previous ends?

## Considered Options

* Yes
* No

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "No", because 
* The user is forced to interact with the page between focus/break, making them acknowledge the switch between sessions.
* It is more intuitive if each session starts with user interaction, since the first session will always require user interaction.

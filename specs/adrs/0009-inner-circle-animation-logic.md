# Logic of the inner circle's animation

* Deciders: All
* Date: 2021-02-23


## Context and Problem Statement

Should the inner circle (aka the remaining time indicator) disappear during the focus session and appear during the break session, or the other way around?

## Decision Drivers

* Some members think the inner circle should start empty and appear during the focus session, while the designer's original idea is the opposite. Thus the question was brought up and discussed during the meeting.

## Considered Options

* Starts empty, appear during the focus session
* Starts full, disappear during the focus session 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Starts full, disappear during the focus session". We agreed that the process of the fruit appears is more rewarding, and we discussed about whether to make the work session more rewarding or the break session. The final decision is to make the break session more rewarding.

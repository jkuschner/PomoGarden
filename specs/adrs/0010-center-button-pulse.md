# Pulse animation of the center button

* Deciders: All
* Date: 2021-02-23


## Context and Problem Statement

In the beginning, the user needs to click on the center button to start the timer. However, although we have a "Start" text on the inner circle, the button still doesn't make it intuitive that it's clickable.

## Decision Drivers

* Some app also has a main button in the center (Shazam for example). Their button has a pulse animation, which allows one to understand that the button is clickable visually. We wanted to give our button a similar effect.

## Considered Options

* Add a pulse animation to the center button
* Or not

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Add a pulse animation to the center button." This animation should not be that difficult, but the animation will allow the user to realize that the middle button can and should be clicked to get started.

# Have a possibility to stop a break session

* Deciders: All 
* Date: 2021-02-14


## Context and Problem Statement
If the user wants to reset the pomo count, they can't do it (without refreshing the browser). The user might want to reset the count because they start a new task and want to track the progress.

## Considered Options
* Have a reset button 
* Don't allow to reset/ remove the progress

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Have a reset button
* It's important to support the customers' needs, so not having such a simple option seems incorrect.
* We don't want to force the user to refresh the website to get what they want because they might choose a different product that gives them the option they want.
* A reset button doesn't conflict without a simplistic/ minimalist approach.
* If the user finished a focus session, they will have an option to reset the progress if they'd like to start a fresh 4 pomo count.

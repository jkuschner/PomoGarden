# Have a possibility to stop a break session

* Deciders: All 
* Date: 2021-02-14


## Context and Problem Statement
When a motivated user wants to continue working and take a shorter break.

## Considered Options
* Allow skipping part of the break session.
* Have an additional field in settings to change break times.
* Don't allow to skip the break.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Allow to skip the break session because
* One of our core principles is to keep the app as simple as it gets - adding an option to have different break times increases the app's complexity.
* The users should have the option to use only part of the break if that is what they prefer.
* Skipping part of the break time allows the user to take only a short break for their essentials and return to work.

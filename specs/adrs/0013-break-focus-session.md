# Have a possibility to stop a focus session

* Deciders: All 
* Date: 2021-02-14


## Context and Problem Statement
The issue is when the user starts working (in focus session) and an (urgent) interruption pops up.

## Considered Options
* Don't have a stop/ break option - leave the app running.
* Have an option to break out of the focus session - when the user is back, they'd start a new pomo.
* Have a stop option - when the user is back, they'd continue from where they left off. 

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Have a break option because
* If something came up and the user must deal with that before completing a focus session, it will give the user the option to do so.
* Doesn't violate the pomo technique by giving credit (focus time accomplished) where it's not due.
* Doesn't violate the pomos technique by having a shorter / splitted focus session
* Pushes the user to commit to what they started, and ignore other interruptions, and finish a session to get the credit they deserve.

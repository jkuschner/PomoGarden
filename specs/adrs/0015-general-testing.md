# General Testing

* Deciders: All
* Date: 2021-02-22

## Context and Problem Statement

Our code needs general testing from all aspects from functionality testing to general use testing. So far we have not tested much as most of our code is easily analyzed through manual testing. However our code is quickly becoming more complex and needs a better set of testing guidelines.

## Decision Drivers
* We need testing guidelines so we can fix possible bugs

## Considered Options

* Manual testing
* Cypress
* Jest

## Decision Outcome

* Testing can be done through a combination of well documented manual testing and Cypress testing

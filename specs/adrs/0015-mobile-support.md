# Support for mobile browsers and screen sizes

* Deciders: All
* Date: 2021-02-17

## Context and Problem Statement

The initial idea was for a website with a desktop focus, but given the design, it seems possible to have it function well on mobile devices with some extra effort. Should the website be developed for mobile devices in mind as well?

## Considered Options

* Support mobile browsers and screen sizes
* Continue to focus on desktop development

## Decision Outcome
Chose option "Support mobile browsers and screen sizes" because
* Having the timer be usable on phone would allow it to be used in a variety of scenarios
* Support for small screen sizes is also good for resizable desktop windows
* Changes needed can be bundled with general ui rework

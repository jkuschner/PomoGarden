## How to make a change to the repo

1. Either checkout the correct branch or make a new branch for the change.
2. Push the changes to the branch you are currently on.
3. Make sure that the changes pass all linting checks and unit tests.
4. Create a pull request for your branch to be merged into `main`
5. Once the pull request receieves at least one review, it can be merged. Ideally the person reviewing the change should be involved with the change.

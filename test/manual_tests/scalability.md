# Scalability Manual Testing

The following tests are to make sure that our app functions normally under different operating conditions such as different browsers, window sizes, and operating systems.

To say that the app functions "normally" means that under different conditions, all of the core features still work and the UI still looks clean(all buttons visible and reasonably sized).

- [ ] OSX
- [ ] Debian based Linux

## Browsers
